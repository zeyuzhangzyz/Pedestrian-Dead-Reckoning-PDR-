# Pedestrian-Dead-Reckoning-PDR
This is a section of the algorithm related to pedestrian re-identification in PDR. The algorithm employs both quaternion methods and decomposition vector methods to achieve a balance, using various techniques such as complementary filtering and interpolation. Before running, the files must be placed in the corresponding directory, or the directory should be modified accordingly. The approach can achieve good results. The analysis process of the reference model has been included. The PDF report has been attached.
